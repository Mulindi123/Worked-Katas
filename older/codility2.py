# Task description
# You are given a string S consisting of N digits. What is the largest sum of two two-digit
# fragments of S? The selected fragments cannot overlap.
# Write a function:
# def solution(S)
# that, given a string S, returns the largest sum of two two-digit numbers that are 
# non-overlapping fragments of S.
# Examples:
# Given S = "43798", the function should return 141. The chosen fragments are "43" and "98": 
# "43 7 98" Given S = "00101", the function should return 10. The chosen fragments are "00" and "10": "00 10 1". 
# Note that fragments "01" and "10" cannot be chosen as they overlap.Given S = "0332331",
# the function should return 66. The chosen fragments are "33" and "33": "0 33 2 33 1".Given S = "00331",
# the function should return 34. The chosen fragments are "03" and "31": "0 03 31"
# Assume that:
# N is an integer within the range [4..100];
# string S is made only of digits (0âˆ’9).
# In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
