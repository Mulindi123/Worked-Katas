# Find the sum of all positive integer roots up to (and including) the nth term of n, 
# whose products are rational positive integers.
# Examples:
# function(1) => 1 as (1root 1 = 1);
# function(9) => 12 as (1root 9 = 9) + (2root 9 = 3);
# function(27) => 30 as (1root 27 = 27) + (3root 27 = 3);
# function(64) => 78 as (1root 64 = 64) + (2root 64 = 8) + (3root 64 = 4) + (6root 64 = 2);
# Test Cases:
# Five select test cases (which are visible to you).
# Of the five, the last is the hardest and will test the precision of your floating point values.
# The first 5000 numbers will be tested.
# Then 100 randomly generated numbers from 1,000,000 to 10,000,000 will be tested.
# Finally, the first 30 powers of 2 will be tested.
# Tip:
# Be careful of data types and floating point values
